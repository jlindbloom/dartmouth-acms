The seminar includes talks broadly on various areas of mathematics such as complex systems, computational science, data science, dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, game theory, machine learning, mathematical biology, network science, numerical analysis, optimization, probability theory & stochastic processes, quantum computing, statistics, statistical mechanics, uncertainty quantification, etc.; hence these talks will keep the breadth of the audience in mind.\n\n\nThe seminar is held weekly on Tuesdays from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 007.\n\n\n<!-- \nThe regular seminar is paused and will resume in Fall 2024. \n\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">*During the summer, we will have the following special session on applications of Koopman operators to climate dynamics. The session is on 6/28/24 from 1:00 -- 2:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 307.</span> \n\n<span style=\"color:red\">We also have an additional talk on 8/6/24 from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall 307. See details below.</span>  -->\n<!-- \n<span style=\"color:red\">*During the summer, we will have the following special session on applications of Koopman operators to climate dynamics.
