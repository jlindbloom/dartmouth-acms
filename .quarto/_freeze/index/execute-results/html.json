The seminar includes talks broadly on various areas of mathematics such as complex systems, computational science, data science, dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, game theory, machine learning, mathematical biology, network science, numerical analysis, optimization, probability theory & stochastic processes, quantum computing, statistics, statistical mechanics, uncertainty quantification, etc.; hence these talks will keep the breadth of the audience in mind.\n\n<!-- The seminar is held weekly on Tuesdays from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 307. -->\n\nThe regular seminar is paused and will resume in Fall 2024. \n\n<span style=\"color:red\">*During the summer, we will have the following special session on applications of Koopman operators to climate dynamics. The session is on 6/28/24 from 1:00 -- 2:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 307. *</span> \n\n<!-- <span style=\"color:red\">*The Monday 5/6/24 talk by Bohan Zhou will be from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM.*</span>\n -->\n\n\n<!-- This cell looks through the seminar_talks YAML file and generates the current seminar schedule. -->\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\nDate     Speaker                                                                                                Title\n-------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6/28/24  [Claire Valva](https://clairevalva.github.io/) (NYU)                                                   [Consistent spectral approximation of Koopman operators: Applications to climate dynamics](/seminar_pages/ValvaSS24.html)\n6/28/24  [Paula Lorenzo SÃ¡nchez](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/paula.lorenzosanche2/en) (University of Bologna)  [Koopman operator theory for enhanced Pacific SST forecasting](/seminar_pages/LorenzoSS24.html)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seminar is organized by Linh Huynh (linh.n.huynh@dartmouth.edu) and Jonathan Lindbloom (jonathan.t.lindbloom.gr@dartmouth.edu).\n\n![](acms_banner.JPG)\n\n",
