Talks, enjoyed in a casual setting, include both outside speakers. The seminar includes talks broadly on mathematics, computational science, network science, stochastic processes, engineering, game theory, mathematical biology, statistics, physical science, complex systems, machine learning, data science, etc.; hence these talks will keep the breadth of the audience in mind.\n\nThe seminar is held weekly on Tuesdays from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 307.\n\n<!-- <span style=\"color:red\">*The Wednesday 2/21/24 talk by Christopher Jones will be from 3:30 -- 4:30 PM.*</span> -->\n\n\n\n<!-- This cell looks through the seminar_talks YAML file and generates the current seminar schedule. -->\n\nDate     Speaker                                                                                                      Title\n-------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------\n3/26/24  [Wenjun Zhao](https://wenjunzhaowo.github.io/) (Brown)                                                       [TBA](/seminar_pages/ZhaoS24.html)\n4/2/24   [Asher Leeks](https://asherleeks.com/) (Yale)                                                                [TBA](/seminar_pages/LeeksS24.html)\n4/9/24   [Erik Bates](https://www.ewbates.com/home) (NCSU)                                                            [TBA](/seminar_pages/BatesS24.html)\n4/16/24  [Carlo Lucibello](https://carlolucibello.github.io/) (Bocconi University)                                    [TBA](/seminar_pages/LucibelloS24.html)\n4/23/24  TBA (None)                                                                                                   [TBA](/seminar_pages/TBA1S24.html)\n4/30/24  TBA (None)                                                                                                   [TBA](/seminar_pages/TBA2S24.html)\n5/7/24   [Zeynep Ertem](https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/people/profile.html?id=zeynep) (Binghamton)                   [TBA](/seminar_pages/ErtemS24.html)\n5/14/24  [James Siderius](https://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/faculty-directory/james-siderius) (Dartmouth, Tuck)  [TBA](/seminar_pages/SideriusS24.html)\n5/21/24  [Kui Ren](https://www.columbia.edu/~kr2002/) (Columbia)                                                      [TBA](/seminar_pages/RenS24.html)\n5/28/24  [Anton Bovier](https://wt.iam.uni-bonn.de/bovier/home/) (UBonn, Germany)                                     [TBA](/seminar_pages/BovierS24.html)\n\n\nThis seminar is organized by Linh Huynh (linh.n.huynh@dartmouth.edu) and Jonathan Lindbloom (jonathan.t.lindbloom.gr@dartmouth.edu).\n\n![](acms_banner.JPG)\n\n",
