Talks, enjoyed in a casual setting, include both outside speakers. The seminar includes talks broadly on mathematics, computational science, network science, stochastic processes, engineering, game theory, mathematical biology, statistics, physical science, complex systems, machine learning, data science, etc.; hence these talks will keep the breadth of the audience in mind.\n\nThe seminar is held weekly on Tuesdays from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 307.\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">*The first three seminars on 1/9/24, 1/16/24, and 1/30/24 will instead be from 2:00 -- 3:00 PM.*</span>\n\n<!-- This cell looks through the seminar_talks YAML file and generates the current seminar schedule. -->\n\nDate     Speaker                                                                                                              Title\n-------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1/9/24   [Mohammad Javad Latifi Jebelli](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~mjebelli/) (Dartmouth, Mathematics)                      [Kernel Smoothing Operators on Thick Open Domains](/seminar_pages/JebelliW24.html)\n1/16/24  [Wei Zhu](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/directory/faculty/wei-zhu) (UMass Amherst)                    [Symmetry-Preserving Machine Learning: Theory and Applications](/seminar_pages/ZhuW24.html)\n1/30/24  [Mario Bencomo](https://csm.fresnostate.edu/math/faculty-staff/resident/mbencomo.html) (California State U, Fresno)  [Topics in Differential Equations, Inverse Problems, and Optimal Control](/seminar_pages/BencomoW24.html)\n2/6/24   [Jeremy Manning](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/jeremy-r-manning) (Dartmouth, PBS)                                 [How do our thoughts take shape?](/seminar_pages/ManningW24.html)\n2/13/24  [Maryclare Griffin](https://maryclare.github.io/) (UMass Amherst)                                                    [Testing and estimation for sparsity-inducing power penalties](/seminar_pages/GriffinW24.html)\n2/20/24  TBA (TBA)                                                                                                            [TBA](/seminar_pages/TBA3W24.html)\n2/27/24  Casey Dowdle (Dartmouth, Mathematics)                                                                                [TBA](/seminar_pages/TBA4W24.html)\n3/5/24   Chris Vales (UNH)                                                                                                    [Energy conservative quadrature based hyperreduction of Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems](/seminar_pages/ValesW24.html)\n3/12/24  [Rachael Alfant](https://rachaelalfant.github.io/) (Rice)                                                            [TBA](/seminar_pages/AlfantW24.html)\n\n\nThis seminar is organized by Linh Huynh (linh.n.huynh@dartmouth.edu) and Jonathan Lindbloom (jonathan.t.lindbloom.gr@dartmouth.edu).\n\n![](acms_banner.JPG)\n\n",
