However, the infinite-dimensional problem is infamously difficult - common difficulties include spectral pollution and continuous spectra. This two part talk will address two examples: (a) computation of spectral measures for general self-adjoint operators (b) computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators. Finally, we discuss how these results fit into a wider programme on infinite-dimensional spectral computations and beyond."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"ColbrookF22.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.577","theme":"simplex","page-layout":"full","title":"On spectral computations in infinite dimensions: Spectral measures, Koopman operators and beyond"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
