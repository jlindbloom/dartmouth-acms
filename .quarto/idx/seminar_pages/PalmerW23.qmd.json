By modifying the ambient metric such that the target geometry is minimal, we can learn arbitrary surfaces and families of surfaces with boundary, providing a building block for larger-scale surface representations. A completely different application of currents is to the problem of computing line or nematic fields, cross fields, and their generalizations on surfaces. Such fields are important to applications in computer graphics and computational engineering, and they have recently shown up in models of biological morphogenesis. Singularities or topological defects are an essential feature of such fields.
