In the first part of this talk, I will discuss how we can understand the ability of over-parameterized statistical models to make accurate predictions even when the number of fitting parameters is much larger than the number of training data points (the so called double-descent phenomenon). If time permits, in the second part of the talk I will discuss how similar techniques also yield interesting insights into complex microbial ecosystems.
