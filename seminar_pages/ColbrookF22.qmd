**Abstract:** Computing spectral properties of operators is fundamental in the sciences, with many applications. However, the infinite-dimensional problem is infamously difficult - common difficulties include spectral pollution and continuous spectra. This two part talk will address two examples: (a) computation of spectral measures for general self-adjoint operators (b) computation of spectral properties of Koopman operators. Finally, we discuss how these results fit into a wider programme on infinite-dimensional spectral computations and beyond.
