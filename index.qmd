The Applied & Computational Mathematics seminar (ACMS) at Dartmouth brings together researchers with common interests in developing mathematical and computational tools to study real-world complex phenomena. The seminar includes talks broadly on various areas of mathematics such as complex systems, computational science, data science, dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, game theory, machine learning, mathematical biology, network science, numerical analysis, optimization, probability theory & stochastic processes, quantum computing, statistics, statistical mechanics, uncertainty quantification, etc.; hence these talks will keep the breadth of the audience in mind.


The seminar is held weekly on Tuesdays from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 007.


<!-- 
The regular seminar is paused and will resume in Fall 2024. 


<span style="color:red">*During the summer, we will have the following special session on applications of Koopman operators to climate dynamics. The session is on 6/28/24 from 1:00 -- 2:30 PM in Kemeny Hall, Room 307.</span> 

<span style="color:red">We also have an additional talk on 8/6/24 from 2:30 -- 3:30 PM in Kemeny Hall 307. See details below.</span>  -->
